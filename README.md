🙋‍♂️ Hello, World!

I am a Full stack developer👨‍💻. I love the idea of automation, and making complex tasks simple. Fascinated about space. I am addicted to strategy games such as Chess ♟️ and am an avid reader 📖.

🔭 I’m currently working working on DevOps, DS&A, SRE, and tackeling my reading list.
<br>
📖 The Pheonix Project (fun read, less technical)
📘 Cracking the Coding Interview (...again, I have nearly mastered interview (jk))
📗 O'Reilly - SRE: How Google Runs Production (new, will update soon)
📓 O'Reilly - SRE: The Site Reliability Workbook (new, im told pairs well with book above)
📚 Future: (Seeking SRE, open to suggestions)
